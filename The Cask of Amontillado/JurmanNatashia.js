You yourself are dressed as a jester, and the bells on your cap jingle as you search for another drink. Out of the corner of your eye, you spot a familiar man making his way towards you.","\n","^“Ah Fortunato, how wonderful it is to see you! You appear to be doing quite well, my friend and what festive attire you have worn for the occasion! I so dearly wish I could partake more in the festival but I must discuss something with you. I have purchased a bottle of what appears to be Amontillado, but I have my doubts.” Montresor shook your hand firmly, seeming incredibly pleased to have found you during the festival.","\n","^“A bottle of Amontillado in the middle of a carnival? How did you manage to come across such a thing? Impossible!” you respond.","\n","^“I told you I was unsure but I paid regardless, hoping to consult you in the matter afterward. However, my friend, I can see that you are engaged with other matters. I will seek out Luchesi, he can tell me of the wine’s authenticity,” Montresor finishes.","\n","^Montresor was right to seek you out to confirm the authenticity of the wine. Afterall you are very skilled in Italian vintages, unlike Luchesi. Even if you have your doubts about the Amontillado’s authenticity now, you cannot allow Luchesi to take this opportunity away from you.","\n","^“Luchesi knows nothing about Amontillado. Come, I will go with you to your vaults. Do not worry, I have no engagement; I would much rather sacrifice some of my time at this carnival than allow you to be led astray by him,” you respond.","\n","^“My friend, I insist that you stay. I can sense that you are afflicted with a cold and my vaults will only worsen your condition,” Montresor replies.","\n","^“Let us go, Montresor. My cough will not encumber me. To the Amontillado!” you counter and the two of you set off to Montresor’s estate.","\n","^Upon arriving at his home, Montresor gathers two torches, handing you one as you make your way through countless rooms and hallways until you make it to the staircase.","\n","^“Be careful,” Montresor warns, before you both begin descending the stairs.","\n","^After descending the stairs for what seems to be a long time, you notice it has become harder to breathe.","\n","^“The Amontillado?” you wheeze.","\n","^“Is farther on. But look upon the walls, do you not observe the nitre which I had spoken of at the carnival?” Montresor replies.","\n","^Instead of responding, you begin to cough violently. The damp air does your cough no favors as you struggle to catch your breath through the fit. Once it has passed, your face feels unbearably warm and your head is uncomfortably light.","\n","^“Fortunato-” Montesor begins.","\n","^“It is nothing. Let us continue,” you insist.","\n","^“No Fortunato, we must go back. You are important to so many people here, I must insist that we return to the carnival,” Montresor responds.","\n","ev","str","^Leave the vault.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},"ev","str","^Continue further into the vault.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":20},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"leave"},"\n",{"#f":5}],"c-1":["^ ",{"->":"keepgoing"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"leave":[["^“Fine, I will admit that I do not feel well. I shall return to the festival,” you concede.","\n","^For a brief moment, Montresor looks disappointed but then he smiles and turns his back to you.","\n","^“Follow me back up the stairs then my friend, let us return.”","\n","^It seems to take hours but you slowly make your way back up the stairs. Montresor again leads you through his estate, stopping at the large doors that constitute the entrance to his home.","\n","^“I trust that you can make your way back safely from here Fortunato. Please enjoy the rest of your time at the carnival, and I shall see you soon,” Montresor states.","\n","ev","str","^Return to the carnival alone.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},"ev","str","^Invite Montresor to return to the carnival with you.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":20},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"alone"},"\n",{"#f":5}],"c-1":["^ ",{"->":"withMontresor"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"alone":["^“Very well then Montresor.

Perhaps we can find another bottle of Amontillado, or, at the very least I can try to repay your concern for my health,” you respond to Montresor.","\n","^Montresor hesitates for a moment but then responds:","\n","^“Very well then my friend, we shall return together.

Then you must not be part of the brotherhood. Such a shame, for a man such as yourself to not be a mason!” you retort.","\n","^“Oh, but I am a mason. Look here,” Montresor asserts, as he pulls a trowel out of his coat.","\n","^You laugh at Montresor and he soon joins you. You wipe your eyes and say:","\n","^“No need to jest.
